	number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should 
	display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, 
	the program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that
	repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.

	integer n. We compute the sine of x using the series and the computation should use all 
	terms in the series up through the term involving xn
	sin x = x - x3/3! + x5/5! - x7/7! + x9/9!......

20. Write a program to compute the cosine of x. The user should supply x and a positive 
	integer n. We compute the cosine of x using the series and the computation should use 
	all terms in the series up through the term involving xn
